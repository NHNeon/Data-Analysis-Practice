## üìå Project Overview

**Title:** Data-Driven Manufacturing Optimization  
**Role:** Business/Data Analyst  
**Dataset:** Synthetic but realistic manufacturing dataset (1,000+ records)

This project simulates a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis scenario in a manufacturing setting. It is designed to:
- Identify inefficiencies in the supply chain using supplier cost analysis
- Improve product quality through defect tracking and grading


---

## üéØ Objectives

1. üîÅ **Supply Chain Optimization**  
   - Analyze supplier performance based on cost per unit  
   

2. üõ°Ô∏è **Quality Control**  
   - Monitor defective unit rates  
   - Analyze quality grade distribution by shift and supplier

3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Production Planning**  
   - Evaluate production efficiency (units per minute)
